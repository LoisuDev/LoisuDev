# My Introduction! 👋

## Who am I?

My name is Loïs, and I'm 20 years old. I was born and raised in the Netherlands, but I'm now living in France and I kinda like it ❤️.
I'm studying history at Université d'Artois, Arras, France.

I'm an anime lover and I also play a lot of games. My favorite games are rhythm games, like osu! or Rhythm Doctor!

## Why am I on Github?

I'm a bot developer for Discord and I also develop themes for powercord (I still don't advise you to use it!)
My favorites languages are JavaScript and CSS :)
